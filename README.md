# project-on-Smart-monitoring-technology
This project deals with the design and implementation of 
Smart surveillance monitoring system using Raspberry
pi. It uses wireless technology to provide essential
security using surveillance system. The proposed
security system captures information and transmits it
via a WiFi to a static IP, which is viewed using a web
browser from any smart device. Raspberry pi controls a
video camera for surveillance. It streams live video and
records the motion detected parts in the cloud and/or in
the windows shared folder for future playback. The
cameras automatically initiate recording when motion is
sensed and the Raspberry pi device stores it in a secured
folder.
